## What is Hack Club?

[**Hack Club**](https://hackclub.com/) is a global, nonprofit network of high school makers & student-led coding clubs. This repository is where we store our [Workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com), which are self-led learn-to-code tutorials, as well as our [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).

 We’re an entirely open source organization—[our website](https://github.com/hackclub/site) to even [our finances](https://bank.hackclub.com/hq) are public. It’s backed by everyone from [Elon Musk](https://hackclub.com/elon/) to the co-founder of GitHub, [Tom Preston-Werner](https://hackclub.com/preston-werner/).

## What is Link Stack?

We made a github repository of all our social media links so that it's easy for everyone to find us and share it with ease.
